## Ubuntu22.04 var/log/syslog to csv


---



This code transforms the syslog to a csv.
It uses pandas data frame.

Usage:

in the location where the trans_log_csv.py is, run in terminal.

```
./trans_log_csv.py
```

It will return  information about the column names, data type, and a count, number of unique values and its frequency, as well an output file with extention csv.

Thanks for looking, 
Mario
